# fibonacci
 Try Controlhub

1. The main interface is created where the index to be found will be received.
2. We create the method to capture the GET variable with the value sent through the http protocol.
3. A Fibonacci class is created where the method to find the index to query is created.
4. Upon receiving the index to consult, we send it to the method to carry out the process and return a JSON with the value obtained.

By creating an api in its initial version in an update, the received parameter can be better validated and the function optimized to improve query performance in a more agile way.
